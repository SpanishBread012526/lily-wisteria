    <h1>Letter to Botchok</h1>

    <p>hey, botchok,</p>

    <p>I honestly am questioning myself how you're doing rn. yk, there are days I really thought I was over you. like I could finally forget everything, move on, and not care anymore yk?</p>

    <p>but then night comes, and I see the moon… the big round pretty moon, or I pass by the church where we used to walk—and suddenly, I remember everything.</p>

    <p>I stupidly cry myself to sleep sometimes, and that's when I realized… I still love you. I still miss you. over and over again. maybe some people don’t ever really leave your heart. yeah?</p>

    <p>i love you, hope to see you once for last.</p>
