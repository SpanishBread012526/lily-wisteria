  <h2><B><I>Hey, Botchok,</I></B></h2>
  <p>
   <B><I> I honestly am questioning myself how you're doing rn. yk, there are days I really thought I was over you. like I could finally forget everything, move on, and not care anymore yk?
  </I></B></p>
  <p>
  <B><I>  But then night comes, and I see the moon…the big round pretty moon, or I pass by the church where we used to walk—and suddenly, I remember everything.
  </I></B></p>
  <p>
   <B><I> I stupidly cry myself to sleep sometimes, and that's when I realized…I still love you. I still miss you. over and over again. maybe some people don’t ever really leave your heart. yeah?
  </I></B></p>
  <p>
  <B><I>  I love you,<br>
hope to see you once for last.
 </I></B> </p>
